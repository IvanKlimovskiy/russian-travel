        <p class="intro__text">According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to
          spend
          holiday in your home country. Like, what have we not seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with
          the gentle sea of ​​the south, the dense forests of the Sayans and the harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau. And see all these beauties
          can
          without millions in the account, a passport and many hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova -
          bold
          young
          mother, who took three children in an armful, put them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers along
          native
          country. We have selected and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.</p>

            <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia.
              First of all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and
              lakes. And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places - the mountain
              air.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is temperate, so it is best to go here in summer. So you will see
              all the variety of local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and on the plains
              deer graze. And the famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.</p>

            <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, it's all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for competitions in
              skiing. This is a sport where the skier ties himself
              to the motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019 at the festival
              "Baikal Mile" was set a world record - 197.011 km / h.</p>
