          without millions in the account, a passport and many hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova -

          <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia.
            First of all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and
            lakes. And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places - the mountain
            air.</p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is temperate, so it is best to go here in summer. So you will see
            all the variety of local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and on the plains
            deer graze. And the famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.</p>

            in the world. Many also know that this is the largest source of fresh water and one of the most beautiful places in Russia.

          <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, it's all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for competitions in
            skiing. This is a sport where the skier ties himself
            to the motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019 at the festival
            "Baikal Mile" was set a world record - 197.011 km / h.</p>

            national parks because of the impenetrable swamps never knew the ax. Some pines are already more than
            half a millennium. Touch a living creature that saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it.
            In the virgin forest for a hundred kilometers you will not find a path. And on rare paths trees
            a couple of meters from the ground are marked with bear claws. Let everyone know who's boss.</p>
